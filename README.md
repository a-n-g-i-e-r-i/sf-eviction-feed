A website that will serve as a resource for evictions in San Francisco.  Its aim is to synthesize tenants rights information and existing advocacy efforts into a social forum. Users are able to upload photos, correspondence, and documents. The app creates a paper trail, and connects users to rights organizations.

## Technologies

EvictUs was created as a full stack web application using Mongoose, Express, jQuery/AJAX, and Node.js.
